Defaults:
    FORWARD  = 'W'
    BACKWARD = 'S'
    LEFT     = 'A'
    RIGHT    = 'D'
These defaults match the conventional WASD movement keys. If your keyboard or
preferences differ (for example, using ESDF), update the
constants accordingly. The application will reload these values on start and
use them for both input listening and movement classification.
Note:
    Only single‐character alphanumeric keys are supported. Special keys like
    arrow keys are not guaranteed to work because the underlying input
    library may not provide a `.char` attribute for non‐alphanumeric keys.
